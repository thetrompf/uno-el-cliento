"Uno el Cliento"
================

"Uno el Cliento" - is the code name for a new client side application framework.
Put shortly - we absolutely *love* the philosophy behind [KnockoutJS](http://www.knockoutjs.com),
however the library does lack some functionality when it comes to application architecture -
at least if your goal is to create one-page applications. This is a problem we intend to solve!

Everything will be written in CoffeeScript - and written as RequireJS modules. Once done,
we're hoping the framework will enable structured web applications with great user experience
and low friction development to be created with ease.

The project is still very young and ideas are still being implemented.
